~~UPDATE the spawn decks to use the current architecture~~
consider what code resuse will look like with custom start, not currently satisfied with current design
For normal start, you probably want to make a button that reveals or spawns the rest of the unused mission deck since you may want to randomize the characters but not the missions... or even better, maybe just make a button that gives the players a random result in the global chat for a character in the custom start version.
~~Code health dial~~
Code buttons for Mission track up and down movement
Code the turn progression thing that auto-advances you when your turn starts and can auto draw your cards on turn end?... likely have to make a scriping zone in front of the player that gets all played cards and will likely have to show this to the user. That way a script can collect all the cards in that scripting zone, throw them in the discard, then try to draw 5 cards for the user on turn end and shuffle discard if need be
